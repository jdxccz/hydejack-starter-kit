## General

This is a Python program that uses the open API to retrieve historical stock quotes and predict the opening and closing prices of a given stock. It uses linear regression models to train on past data and predict future prices. The program asks the user to input a stock code, retrieves the necessary data, trains the models, and outputs the predicted opening and closing prices of the next day.
