### Motto: "Always be a decent man in any indecent time!"

Version 9 is the most complete version of Hydejack yet.
{:.lead}

[Modernized](#linking-in-style) [design](#whats-in-the-cards), [big headlines](#ready-for-the-big-screen), big new features: [Built-In Search](#built-in-search), [Sticky Table of Contents](#sticky-table-of-contents), and [Auto-Hiding Navbar](#auto-hiding-navbar). That [and more](#and-much-more) is Hydejack 9.

- Table of Contents
{:toc .large-only}

## Linking in Style

Ever since the introduction of Dark Mode, link styles have been a bit of an issue. Specifically, finding an accent color that worked on both light and dark backgrounds was the problem. With Hydejack 9, the [link style](#linking-in-style) has been revamped so that legibility is no longer tied to the choice of accent_color, giving you much more freedom in creating a unique design flavor for your site.
 
## Sticky Table of Contents

Already a staple on so many sites on the web, this pattern is now also available in Hydejack. 
What's unique about it is that it simply picks up the table of contents already created by kramdown's `{:toc}` tag and transparently upgrades it to a fully dynamic version.
 
## …and much more

Other noteworthy changes include:
- Support for Jekyll 4
- Choice between MathJax and KaTeX for math rendering
- Use of `jekyll-include-cache` for drastically improved page building speeds
- New variables configuration file — adjust content width, sidebar width, font size, etc...
- ...and the option to disable grouping projects by year.

Read the the [CHANGELOG](../../CHANGELOG.md){:.heading.flip-title} for the full scope of features and improvements made in Hydejack 9.
Maybe just glance at it to confirm that it is indeed a pretty long list.
 
## Even More to Come

New features for 9.1 are already lined up. Code block headers and code line highlights for even better technical blogging, as well as download buttons on the resume page for PDF, vCard, and Resume JSON are just around the corner.
