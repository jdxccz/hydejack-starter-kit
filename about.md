# About me

<!--author-->

### Motto: "Always be a decent man in any indecent time!"

## Resume/CV

In case you want more detail about my works, this is my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TcrHb47CKAd7ULcd0aixKtFr77J5Elrs/view?usp=share_link">Resume</a>.

## Why I choose to work on Computer Science?

I experience many exciting moments when I finish programming projects, even small ones. It feels like having Harry Potter's wand and being capable of anything when programming. Although debugging can be frustrating at times, once the issue is resolved, the satisfaction is doubled. Overall, the feeling of accomplishment and joy I get from programming is incomparable.

## Programme Language

Python, C++, C, Shell, Sql, Go, Haskell, HTML, Markdown

## Travel

> "The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page." - Saint Augustine

I really love traveling because it's a great way to take a break from the routine and find some balance between work and play. From the mountains of the North to the beaches of the South, I have roamed the corners of my homeland China. And beyond its borders, I have explored cultures that enthrall me: Japan's ancient customs, Russia's enduring beauty, America's vast diversity, and Mexico's vibrant spirit. Right now, I'm living in California, and I'm always on the lookout for my next adventure.
